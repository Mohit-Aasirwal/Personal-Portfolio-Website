## 💬 What was your favorite part of building this?
My favorite part was definitely crafting the overall user experience and interactions — from the micro-animations using Framer Motion to the way sections smoothly respond on different screen sizes. It was exciting to bring life to the portfolio and make it feel dynamic and expressive. I enjoyed designing it as much as I enjoyed coding it, especially when turning abstract ideas into reusable, clean components.

Also, getting to showcase my work and personality in a visual and interactive way — that’s always fun as a developer 😄

## 🧗 What was the hardest part, and how did you handle it?
One of the trickiest parts was balancing visual appeal with performance and accessibility. When you're working with animations, custom layouts, and image-heavy sections, it's easy to lose sight of load times or SEO impact. I tackled this by:

Lazy loading images and assets using Next.js’ Image component

Optimizing components for reusability and tree-shaking

Using Lighthouse audits to iterate and fix bottlenecks

Writing semantic HTML and ensuring keyboard accessibility

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This

I wanted a place that speaks for me when I'm not around — something that reflects my developer identity, showcases what I’ve built, what I believe in, and how I solve problems.  
This portfolio is not just a site — it's my **professional narrative** in code.

## 🛠️ How It's Built

The project is built from scratch using `Next.js` for SSR and routing, `TailwindCSS` for styling etc. Animations are powered by `Framer Motion`, and deployments are managed via `Vercel` for seamless CI/CD. Every component is modular and reusable, allowing fast iteration.
